Out for a walk one day, a woman came across a construction site and saw three men working.
有一天出去散步的时候，一个女人来到一处工地上，她看到有三个人在工作。

 She asked the first man, “What are you doing?” Annoyed by the question, the first man barked,
她问第一个人，“你在做什么？“，第一个男人对这个问题感到非常的厌烦，他大声的说到
  “Can’t you see that I’m laying bricks?” Not satisfied with the answer,
”你没看到我正在砌砖吗？“女人对这个答案不大满意，
  
   she asked the second man what he was doing.
她又去问第二个男人他在做什么。


    The second man answered, “I’m building a brick wall.”
第二个男人回答道，”我正在建造一面砖墙。”
    
     Then, turning his attention to the first man, he said,
然后，他把注意力转向了第一个人，他说道，
     
      “Hey, you just passed the end of the wall. You need to take off that last brick.” Again not satisfied with the answer, she asked the third man what he was doing. And the man said to her while looking up in the sky, “I am building the biggest cathedral this world has ever known.” While he was standing there and looking up in the sky the other two men started arguing about the errant brick. The man turned to the first two men and said, “Hey guys, don’t worry about that brick. It’s an inside wall, it will get plastered over and no one will ever see that brick. Just move on to another layer.”1
