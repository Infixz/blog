hypotheticl question:
would you rather be
poor and loved, or
rich and also your
parents are dead?           
假设有个问题：
你是愿意贫穷且有爱，还是
愿意富有且父母双亡？

probably the second one.
I love my parents
but I think they'd want
me to be successful.        
可能是第二个答案。
我爱我的父母，但是我想
他们应该会希望我成功。

that wasn't actually
part of the question.
I was just informing you.
it was an elvator accident.         
这实际上并不是一个问题。
我只是想告诉你这是一起电梯事故。



oh...       
呃。。 。

is it too late to
change my answer?       
现在改变我的答案是不是已经太晚了？

it's too late for a lot of things.     
对很多事情来说都已经太晚了。
