mr. and mrs. jefferson,
we ran some tests and
there's something you need
to know.            
杰斐逊先生和太太，
我们做了一些测验，有些事情
你们需要知道。


it appears as if your
son has a rare genetic disorder.
he probably won't live past five.       
看起来似乎你们的儿子得了一种罕见的遗传疾病。
他可能活不过五。


he'll only live to be five
years old!? oh no!!     
他只能再活五年？哦，不！！

no, no, no. he won't
live past five o'clock.     
不，不，不。他活不到五点钟。

but... it's already 5:15.       
可是。。。现在已经五点十五分了。
