since the big bang 14
billion years ago, the
universe has been expanding.               
自从140亿年前的大爆炸后，宇宙就一直在扩大。


like a balloon being inflated.          
就像一个气球一样一直在膨胀。


the distance between galaxies,
as well as atoms, is increasing
every moment of every day.          
星系之间的距离，原子间的距离，每时每刻
都在增大。


the universe is expanding,
and so is everything in it.         
宇宙一直在扩大，它里面的一切事物也在扩大。

even me.        
甚至我也是。

or maybe you're just
eating too much.        
或者也许你只是吃的太多了。

nope, it's science.     
不是，这是科学。
