有个哥们总是不自觉的[跟我说 IHMO](https://github.com/makinacorpus/django-screamshot/pull/18#issuecomment-23845044)，害我看得一头雾水，只好上网找一下解释了：

> If you're talking about the commonly used IM/chat/e-mail abbreviation, I think you may have transposed a letter.
> 
> "imho" is an acronym for "In my humble opinion."
> 
> On the other hand, if you really are asking about "ihmo," I'm afraid I have no clue. "I have many onions," maybe?

意思是说：一般情况下在网络上是 "In my humble opinion." 即“依我愚见”的简写。
