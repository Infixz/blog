> What is the difference between "may be not" and "may not be" ?
>
> Example:      
> - She may be not a student.     
> - She may not be a student.     
> ==> Do the two sentences have the same meaning?



> [1] She may be not a student, ...      
> Meaning => True, she is not a student, she's a teacher, but she works just as hard as a student. She studies English at home on her own time.
> 
> [2] She may not be a student.      
> Meaning => There is a possibility that she is not a student.
> 
> 
> Modal may, like modal must, is ambiguous between epistemic and deontic modality:
> 
> Deontic modality      
> Ex: She may go to school.      
> => permission; e.g., she is allowed to go.
> 
> Negated      
> Ex: She may not go to school.      
> => permission to go to school is denied.      
> Epistempic modality      
> Ex: She may be at school.      
> => possibility;e.g., It is possible that she is at school.      
> 
> Negated      
> Ex: She may not be at school.      
> => There's a possibility that she is not at school.      
> 
> Ex: She may be not at school, but ...         
> => True, she is not at school, she's at home, but she's at home studying right now as if she were in school.      
> Does that help?
